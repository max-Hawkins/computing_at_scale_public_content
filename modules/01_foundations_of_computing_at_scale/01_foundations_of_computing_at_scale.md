# Foundations of Computing at Scale

## Content Overview
- Motivations for computing
- Moore's law
- Dennard scaling
- Jevons paradox
- From transistors to hyperscale systems
- Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) - good to be familiar with for the rest of the course content
<!-- - XPUs - CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, and DPUs -->

## Self-Evaluation
The following questions are meant for you to assess if you understand the material.

- What are simple definitions (in your own words) of Moore's law, Dennard scaling, and Jevons paradox?

- How have the 3 above trends impacted modern computing at scale?

- What is a GPU and how is it different from a CPU?

- (For fun) How many unique definitions of Moore's law can you find? Which is the original?
