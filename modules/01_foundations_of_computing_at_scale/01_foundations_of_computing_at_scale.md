## Self-Evaluation
The following questions are meant for you to assess if you understand the material.

- What are simple definitions (in your own words) of Moore's law, Dennard scaling, and Jevons paradox?

- How have the 3 above trends impacted modern computing at scale?

- (For fun) How many unique definitions of Moore's law can you find? Which is the original?
