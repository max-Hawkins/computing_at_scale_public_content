# Computing at Scale - The Design, Operation, and Societal Impacts of Data Centers

This repository contains the public course content for a course offered through Georgia Tech's Online Masters of Computer Science program. Content additions and edits are encouraged through pull requests. The aim is to provide a public and central resource for educational material on data centers including research papers, videos, books, self-quizzes, and more.
